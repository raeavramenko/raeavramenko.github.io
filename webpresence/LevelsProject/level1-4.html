        <p>A Paean-Poem<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Edgar Allan Poe</p>
        <p>I.</p>
        <p>How shall the burial rite be read? 
The solemn song be sung? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young?</p>
        <p>II.</p>
        <p>Her friends are gazing on her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her gaudy bier,<br>
And weep! - oh! to dishonor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead beauty with a tear! </p>
        <p>III.</p>
        <p>They loved her for her wealth -
And they hated her for her pride -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her - that she died.</p>
        <p>IV.</p>
        <p>They tell me (while they speak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her 'costly broider'd pall') <br>
That my voice is growing weak -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should not sing at all -</p>
        <p>V.</p>
        <p>Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So mournfully - so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.</p>
        <p>VI.</p>
        <p>But she is gone above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With young Hope at her side,<br>
And I am drunk with love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dead, who is my bride. -</p>
        <p>VII.</p>
        <p>Of the dead - dead who lies
All perfum'd there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death upon her eyes,
And the life upon her hair.</p>
        <p>VIII.</p>
        <p>Thus on the coffin loud and long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strike - the murmur sent<br>
Through the grey chambers to my song,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be the accompaniment.</p>
        <p>IX.</p>
        <p>Thou died'st in thy life's June -
But thou did'st not die too fair:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou did'st not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.</p>
        <p>X.</p>
        <p>From more than fiends on earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy life and love are riven,<br>
To join the untainted mirth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of more than thrones in heaven -</p>
        <p>XII.</p>
        <p>Therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But waft thee on thy flight,
With a PÃ¦an of old days.</p>

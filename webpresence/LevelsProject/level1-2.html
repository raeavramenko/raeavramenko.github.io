        <p>A Paean-Poem by Edgar<br>Allan Poe</p>
        <p><br>I. How shall the burial rite <br><br>be read? 
The solemn song<br>be sung? 
The requiem for<br><br>the loveliest dead,
That ever <br>died so young?</p>
        <p><br>II. Her friends are gazing on <br><br>her,
And on her gaudy <br>bier,
And weep! - oh! to <br><br>dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear! </p>
        <p><br>III. They loved her for her <br><br>wealth -
And they hated her <br>for her pride -
But she <br><br>grew in feeble health,
And <br>they love her - that she died.</p>
        <p><br>IV. They tell me (while they <br><br>speak
Of her 'costly broider'd pall')<br> 
That my voice is growing <br><br>weak -
That I should not <br>sing at all -</p>
        <p><br>V. Or that my tone should <br><br>be
Tun'd to such solemn <br>song
So mournfully - so mournfully,<br><br>
That the dead may feel <br>no wrong.</p>
        <p><br>VI. But she is gone above,<br><br>
With young Hope at her <br>side,
And I am drunk <br><br>with love
Of the dead, <br>who is my bride. -</p>
        <p><br>VII. Of the dead - dead who <br><br>lies
All perfum'd there,
With <br>the death upon her eyes,<br><br>
And the life upon her hair.</p>
        <p><br>VIII. Thus on the coffin loud <br><br>and long
I strike - the <br>murmur sent
Through the grey <br><br>chambers to my song,
Shall <br>be the accompaniment.</p>
        <p><br>IX. Thou died'st in thy life's <br><br>June -
But thou did'st not <br>die too fair:
Thou did'st <br><br>not die too soon,
Nor <br>with too calm an air.</p>
        <p><br>X. From more than fiends on <br><br>earth,
Thy life and love <br>are riven,
To join the <br><br>untainted mirth
Of more than <br>thrones in heaven -</p>
        <p><br>XII. Therefore, to thee this night<br><br>
I will no requiem raise,<br>
But waft thee on thy <br><br>flight,
With a Paean of <br>old days.</p>

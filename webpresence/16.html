        <p>"We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and- in spite of True
        Romance magazines- we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely- at least, not all the time- but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness." -H.T.</p>
        <p>"It's about a girl who is on the cusp of becoming someone. A girl who may not know what she wants right now, and she may not know who she is right now, but who deserves the chance to find out." -J.P.</p>

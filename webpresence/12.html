        <p>"We could never understand why the girls cared so much about being
        mature, or why they felt compelled to compliment each other, but
        sometimes, after one of us had read a long portion of the diary out loud, we had to fight back the urge to hug one another or tell each other how pretty we were. We felt the imprisonment of being a girl, the way it made your mind active and dreamy, and how you ended up knowing which colors went together. We knew that the girls were our twins, that we all existed in space like animals with identical skins, and that they
        knew everything about us though we couldn'y fathom them at all. We knew finally that the girls were really woman in diquise, that they
        understood love even death, and that our job was merely to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them." -J.E.</p>

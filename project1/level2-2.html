        <p><h5><strong>A Paean-Poem </strong><em>by Edgar Allan Poe</em></h5> </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>I.</h1></p>
        <p>How shall the burial rite be read? <br>
The <em>solemn song </em>be sung? <br>
The requiem for the loveliest dead, <br>
That ever died <em>so young?</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>II.</h1></p>
        <p>Her friends are gazing on her,<br>
And on her gaudy bier,<br>
And <em>weep! </em>- oh! to dishonor<br>
Dead beauty with a tear! </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>III.</h1></p>
        <p>They loved her for her wealth -<br>
And they <em>hated her</em> for her pride -<br>
But she grew in feeble health,<br>
And they love her - <em>that she died.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>IV.</h1></p>
        <p>They tell me (while they speak<br>
Of her <em>'costly broider'd pall'</em>) <br>
That my voice is growing weak -<br>
That I should <em>not sing at all -</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>V.</h1></p>
        <p>Or that my tone should be<br>
Tun'd to such solemn song<br>
So mournfully - <em>so mournfully,</em><br>
That the dead may feel no wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>VI.</h1></p>
        <p>But she is <em>gone above,</em><br>
With young Hope at her side,<br>
And I am drunk with love<br>
Of the dead, who is <em>my bride. -</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>VII.</h1></p>
        <p>Of the dead - <em>dead who lies</em><br>
All perfum'd there,<br>
With the death upon her eyes,<br>
And the <em>life</em> upon her hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>VIII.</h1></p>
        <p>Thus on the coffin loud and long<br>
<em>I strike</em> - the murmur sent<br>
Through the grey chambers to my song,<br>
Shall be the accompaniment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>IX.</h1></p>
        <p>Thou died'st in thy life's June -<br>
But thou did'st not die <em>too fair:</em><br>
Thou did'st not die <em>too soon,</em><br>
Nor with <em>too calm</em> an air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>X.</h1></p>
        <p>From more than fiends on earth,<br>
Thy life and love <em>are riven,</em><br>
To join the untainted mirth<br>
Of more than <em>thrones in heaven -</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>XII.</h1></p>
        <p>Therefore, to thee <em>this night</em><br>
I will no requiem raise,<br>
But <em>waft thee</em> on thy flight,<br>
With a Paean of old days.</p>
